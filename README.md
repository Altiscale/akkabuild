# akkabuild

The build script to generate some RPM for https://github.com/Altiscale/akka

The script here is a simple one that just wrap existing JARs from maven repo.
We currently don't re-build them from source until we need to tweak/patch the source code
or customize it. Currently, we are taking it as-is.
